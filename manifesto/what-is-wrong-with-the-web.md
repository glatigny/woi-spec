# Introduction

Before writing about "what is wrong with the web", the first part focus on the email communication.\
It is important to start with that one before talking about the web (in general), to avoid writing about the exact same issues.

[See reflexions on "what is wrong with emails"](what-is-wrong-with-emails.md)

Thus, the world need new way of communicating asynchronously.\
Reducing the global energy costs, the spam, the phising is also very important for the world wide web.

For the past years, the increase of *GenIA* changed how people can process and create content (text, images, audio and videos).\
It is a tool, which can speed up the work of people. The notion of *good* or *bad* is not to debate.

## World wide web

Like the creation of the email, when the "web" was designed, it was with a good intention: to share the knowledge.\
The web was "small", it was to share content with people who knew the address; there were some "search engines" which was more like directories since you needed to register your website, add it into a category to be classified.

It was designed to be decentralized, a web server could be on a random machine (server).\
Web pages were just HTML pages, no CSS, no JavaScript, not the needs we have now.
