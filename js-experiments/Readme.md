# Social Infrastructure - JS Testing

Some tests made between January 2021 and August 2023 to create a cryptographic identity, add relations and exchange messages.\
The goal was to be fully standalone in a web browser, using the less libs as possible and JavaScript cryptographic functions.

No TypeScript (no transpilation), usage of JS private functions/members to secure (as possible) the keys.

That small project was the starting point of reflexions regarding the `web of identities`.
